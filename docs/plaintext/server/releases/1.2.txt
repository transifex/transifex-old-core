  December 2011

Transifex-1.0 was a huge breakthrough for us since it revolutionized L10n
workflow in many ways, like handling translations on a per-string level, adding
the .ts file format and introducing of our powerful API. Transifex-1.1
introduced a ton of fixes and improvements that refined the whole experience.

What's new in Transifex CE 1.2
==============================

New file formats: .desktop, dtd, mozilla .properties, .strings, .wiki, xliff.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is always better to have support for a wide range of i18n file formats. This
release has implemented native support for the following file formats.

- `.desktop`: .desktop file contains "desktop entries", or configuration files
  describing how a particular program is launched, how it appears in menu, etc.
  It is widely used by KDE and Gnome
- `.dtd`: A DTD file contains a list of entities that need to be localized.
  The entities here defined are then used inside the user interface XUL files.
- `mozilla .properties`: In these files a number of JavaScript properties
  (consider them as variables) are assigned with a string value. This format is
  a lot like the .properties files from Java but it supports unicode.
- `Apple .strings`: Apple .strings files are used for the localization of Mac
  OS X and iPhone applications.
- `.wiki`: A .wiki file is expected to contain text formatted in the wikiML
  format, eg articles from Wikipedia.
- `.xliff`: XLIFF (XML Localisation Interchange File Format) is an XML-based
  format created to standardize localization.


Pseudo translation files
------------------------

This is a very important tool in the i18n process. It helps software developers
check their application in terms of proper i18n support. Transifex can now
produce language files with fake translated strings that appear distorted, are
of greater length than the source strings but are still readable. Developers can
use this "pseudo" language file when compiling their product and view the
outcome. This is needed to make sure that the product supports multiple
languages, that all strings that should be translated are marked as localizable
and that the product supports different size and encoding where the original
strings are placed.

Pseudo tranlsation files are of course being used during the i18n testing of
Transifex itself; here's a sneek peek:

Review/proofread translations
-----------------------------

Transifex 1.2 introduces a way for project maintainers to control the quality of
their translations. Every language team can have a number of reviewers (team
members with reviewing privileges, set by the team coordinator or the project
maintainer) responsible for proofreading the translated strings and marking them
as reviewed. Reviewers can add, edit and suggest translations normally. The
process takes place through Lotte, by using the checkboxes visible next to each
string's entry. The reviewing interface is only visible to reviewers and project
maintainers while translators can only see which strings have been reviewed so
far.


Webhooks: HTTP callbacks for automatic notification of events
-------------------------------------------------------------
Transifex allows you to specify a `web hook
<http://wiki.webhooks.org/w/page/13385124/FrontPage>`_ for the translations of
your project. This way, you can get notified whenever the translation of a
resource is modified. This opens many possibilities for the maintainers of the
project, like pulling translations as soon as they are completed. To use this
feature, you have to add a URL for the project. This URL should expect a POST
request with the following variables, JSON-formatted:

- `project` : The slug of the project this notification is for.
- `resource`: The slug of the resource this notification is for.
- `language`: The language code of the translation that was modified.
- `percent` : An integer that represents the rate of translation for the
  particular resource in the particular language.


User authentication through 3rd-party services (twitter, facebook, google accounts, linkedin).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Transifex 1.2 adds support for social registration that gives users the ability
to create a Transifex account in just one step, by using the account provider of
their choice. Currently, the supported providers are Twitter, Google Account,
Facebook and LinkedIn. The relevant user profile fields are populated
automatically.

Existing Transifex accounts can be associated with social accounts as well.
Using your linked social account you can sign in to Transifex without filling a
form; just by following the appropriate links in the login page. Account
associations are available from the profile settings.

The feature is available on both Transifex.com and hosted versions of Transifex
Community Edition.


Resource categories
-------------------

For projects that house a big number of categories, Transifex now supports an
extra level of hierarchy. You can now organize project resources into categories
via the project-edit form. You will be further able to view your resources
categorized in all pages that show them. The 'categories' field is also
accesible via our API.


Django-1.3 compatibility
------------------------

Transifex has moved on top of Django 1.3 in this version. Django 1.3 has 
brought a number of improvements around how static files are served and 
organized in Transifex, among with the possibility of using the 
``django_compressor`` app to compress JavaScript and CSS, making the loading
of pages faster.


New user account and profile pages
----------------------------------

Besides the authentication through 3rd-party services, which is referred as 
social auth, Transifex also has moved on top of a modern and more maintained
and secure upstream application for handling the users accounts and profiles.
This application is called django-userena and is responsible for important 
parts of the system such as the user signing up, password rescue and such
things.

As a consequence to it, the location feature using Google maps was removed 
along with client-side cropping of the avatar using JavaScript. These features
might come back in the future if decided that they should so.

Getting Transifex CE 1.2
========================

You can experience Transifex live at http://www.transifex.com/. This upstream
instance is hosted by Transifex, the company behind the development of Transifex.

Project and community managers who want to deploy Transifex for their
own community may refer to the :ref:`Installation documentation <installing>`.


Upgrading to this version
=========================

To upgrade the code, update your package distribution as usual:

- If you installed from your package distribution, check if there's been a
  package upgrade and go for it.
- If you used ``easy_install``, run ``easy_install -U`` to upgrade.
- Fresh tarballs are available, if you installed from a release zipfile.
- Finally, if you're of the daredevil kind and feed straight from the source,
  ``git pull`` should do the trick for you.


Dependencies
------------

The following extra dependencies were *added* since the last major version:

- Django >= 1.3.1
- django-userena
- django-addons >= 0.6.6
- django-social-auth
- django-tagging-autocomplete
- django_compressor

Instructions on how to install the dependencies can be found at the
:ref:`Installation docs <installing>`. You'll need to complete this step
before actually doing the database migration.



Migration
---------

Transifex 1.2 has undergone some changes in its database schema. However it's
very easy to migrate to the new database using the python commands included in
the main directory. To do this, you need to run::

    python manage.py syncdb --noinput
    python manage.py migrate copyright 0001 --fake
    python manage.py migrate --ignore-ghost-migrations --noinput


Then, you only need to create new notice types, new languages and new static
media by executing the following commands::

    python manage.py txcreatenoticetypes
    python manage.py txlanguages
    python manage.py collectstatic

.. note::

    Depending on the size of the database and the number or projects and
    resources that you have, this process may take up to several minutes.


Sample Migration
::::::::::::::::

A sample run for a migration from Transifex CE 1.1 to Transifex CE 1.2
follows (all stdout/sterr output are omitted)::

    git clone git@github.com:transifex/transifex.git
    git checkout 1.2
    python manage.py syncdb --noinput
    python manage.py migrate copyright 0001 --fake
    python manage.py migrate --ignore-ghost-migrations --noinput
    python manage.py txcreatenoticetypes
    python manage.py txlanguages
    python manage.py collectstatic

.. note::

    Why the name 'Mystique'?

    Mystique (Raven Darkhölme) is a fictional character associated with the
    Marvel Comics' franchise X-Men. Originally created by artist David Cockrum
    and writer Chris Claremont, she first appeared in Ms. Marvel #16.

    Throughout most of her history, Mystique has been a supervillain, founding
    her own Brotherhood of Mutants and assassinating several important people
    involved in mutant affairs. Mystique herself is a mutant, a shapeshifter
    whose natural appearance includes blue skin and yellow eyes. At one point,
    she mentions that she is over 100 years old. Mystique is the mother of the
    villain Graydon Creed, the X-Men hero Nightcrawler, and adoptive mother of
    the hero Rogue. She is forced to abandon Nightcrawler, but raises Rogue for
    a number of years, and the two women have mixed feelings towards one
    another.

    Despite Mystique's history of crime, she works with the X-Men's Professor X
    in a short-lived series. She is later voted straight into the X-Men.

    All the above match perfectly with the characteristics of Transifex CE 1.2
    ifself. The best is yet to come.
