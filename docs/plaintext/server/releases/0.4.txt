=======================================
 Transifex version 0.4.x release notes
=======================================

Transifex 0.4 was planned to be the last major stable release from the
TurboGears branch.

Seeing that 0.3 was pretty stable and the new features on 0.4 were already
implemented in the Django branch (to be named 0.5), the Transifex development
team decided to continue supporting the 0.3 branch for a few more months and
skip shipping a 0.4 release, allowing more focus on the newest and greatest
release based on the Django framework.

The relevant features from below were either backported to 0.3 or shipped with
Transifex 0.5.
