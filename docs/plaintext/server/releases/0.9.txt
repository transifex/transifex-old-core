Being served hot at Transifex.com
---------------------------------

Transifex 0.9 is a release of the open-source, community-powered Transifex
flavor. It is suitable for very large projects with their own existing
translation community, such as the Fedora Project, the GNOME Desktop, etc.

Transifex is also offered as a Software-as-a-Service, at
www.transifex.com_, ready to serve your translation needs with a few clicks.
Transifex.com is a one-stop, batteries-included hosted service serving more
than 900 independent projects and businesses who don't want to worry about
deploying their own Transifex instance.

Transifex.com is managed by Transifex_, the company sponsoring the development
of Transifex.


What's new in Transifex 0.9
---------------------------

Let's see what's fresh!


Extension engine
::::::::::::::::

Transifex 0.9 sports a brand-new extension engine called django-addons_, which
allows developers to write plug-and-play extensions (or plug-ins) which extend
or override parts of the core functionality. django-addons_ was developed by
the Transifex team and is now shipped as a reusable Django application.

.. _django-addons: http://code.transifex.com/django-addons/

Here are some of the benefits of this feature:

- **Extensibility**: By creating hooks and connectors in the Transifex core code,
  extra code can be decoupled and stored in separate directories. This allows
  more functionality to be added when needed with less hassle. 
- **Reduced code complexity**: By storing code in more and smaller files, the code
  is more readable and manageable.
- **Scalability**: Addons can be enabled and disabled on the production web-server,
  and addons which fully support this functionality can simply be
  deactivated when necessary (for example, when too much traffic hits your site).
- **Friendlier code**: New developers can more easily experiment with new features
  without having to mess with Transifex internals which might seem complex at
  first sight.

A number of Transifex modules have been converted to addons, which can be
disabled if required by circumstance. Here's a list of them::

    $ ./manage.py addons
    Available addons:
     * charts - Google Charts for Transifex
     * locks - Locking mechanism for Transifex
     * presubmit_checks
     * repowatch - Repository watching
     * timeline - Timeline for Transifex
     * txcron - Transifex Cronjobs
     * widgets - Transifex Widgets
     
Finally, for the Django developers out there, here are some of the features
supported by django-addons:

- Automatic URL discovery of addons: No need to tweak your main project's
  'url.py' file.
- Automatic signal connecting of addons
- Support for 'default settings' per addon
- Template hooking system (inject code from addons into your main project)
- Support for 'django-staticfiles' to serve site media from each addon
- Automatic registration of 'django-notification_' notice types
- Support for storing and loading localization from inside each addon
- Disable addons using a management command: ``./manage.py addons``
- Addons overview page, allowing admins to learn which addons are currently
  active.

For a full list of features and code examples, please refer to the
`django-addons documentation`_ itself.

Project Team Sharing
::::::::::::::::::::

A great new feature is the ability to share translation teams between projects.
A Transifex project can now 'outsource' its language teams to another one,
effectively trusting and re-using the other project's community to translate
its own resources.

Why is this useful? Open source software projects tend to group together in
larger communities. Good examples of such project collections are desktop
environments, such as GNOME and KDE, or distributions, such as Fedora and
Moblin. Since Transifex supports per-project translation teams, these
communities requested the ability to re-use the collection's translation teams
instead of managing their own.

This control can accessed by Project Maintainers under the tab "Access Control".
Note that a project's fine-grained permission and team controls are disabled
when the project outsources its access control.

.. figure:: /static/images/shots/0.9/outsource.png
   :class: alcenter shot2

The Teams Outsourcing feature is the major lever behind the very influential
website http://meego.transifex.com/. There, the MeeGo project, a common effort
between Intel, Nokia, and the Linux Foundation, hosts the translations of a large
number of projects, all being translated by the same community: The MeeGo
Localization Community.


Widgets
:::::::

Starting with this version, each Transifex project now has its own Widgets.
You may now display your project's translation statistics on your website
as a simple image. Perfect for embedding in wiki pages, Trac instances, and email.
The chart will always reflect your live Transifex numbers.

Widgets are publicly accessible from a tab on the Project Details page.
Additional widgets may be available in the next releases in the same place.

.. figure:: /static/images/shots/0.9/chart.png
   :class: alcenter shot2


Improved file ownership
:::::::::::::::::::::::

The file locking feature has been greatly improved in this version. The new
functionality more closely resembles "file ownership". Here's a list of the
improvements:

- The download button has been replaced with the message "Download for viewing",
  indicating that this action will not also assign the translation to the person
  clicking it.
- Submit access has been restricted to the person holding the lock.
- Editing with the online translation editor automatically locks the file.
- Users are only allowed to lock 2 files and locks expire by default after
  2 days, signifying the importance of the file ownerships. Both these settings
  are configurable by the Transifex administrator.
- When a file ownership is about to expire (e.g. 12 hours before), a
  warning is sent to the owner.
- Users can submit part of their job and opt to continue working on their files
  by extending the lock as part of submitting the file.
- The owner of a file is allowed to "Extend lock for 2 more days" by clicking
  the related icon next to the file.
- Language coordinators are able to remove ownership from other people's files
  for the language files they manage.

   :class: alcenter shot2


More supported i18n directory structures
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Transifex 0.9 introduces an overhaul of the ``guess_language`` method using
regular expressions (tickets #541, #542), adding support for a number of i18n
directory structures and shows improved extensibility.

This method is run whenever the statistics are refreshed, so approximately once
per day. The new code has no visible overhead (when run against 30.000 files, it
takes 300 milliseconds, compared to 140 milliseconds previously).

The standard directory structures now supported are the following:

#. PO files inside a po directory named with the language code
   (``/po/<lang>.po``). Depending on the i18n method, a POT file might or
   might not be available.

#. The LC_MESSAGES locale standard (``/<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/something.po``).

#. Grouped language files (``/po/el/foo.po``)

#. Suffixed language files (``/po/foo.el.po``)
   
#. The Publican standard structure. The languages are discovered by the
   presence of the 'pot' directory in the tree. A 'pot' directory is needed to
   allow language discovery.


More pre-submit checks
::::::::::::::::::::::

Transifex now supports more validation checks for a submission. This helps
avoid bad submissions and can reduce the maintenance overhead for the
developer and Transifex administrator. Here is a list of the new checks:

- Reject empty files (0% translations)
- Reject changes to POT files
- Warn in the presence of DOS line endings in the file
- Option to disallow anything other than UTF-8 header encoding
- Check the existence of a 'Plurals-Form' header in a file


Various improvements and bugfixes
---------------------------------


Improved searching
::::::::::::::::::

The search box now also crawls in project names and descriptions, components,
repository URLs. Now, users can search for projects having specific keywords
in their description, projects hosted on a particular hosting website such as
Gitorious, etc.


Improved handling of VCS Errors
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Transifex now shows errors from the related VCS back-end in the UI. This will
allow project developers to better understand what's wrong with their project
repository URL and fix it accordingly.


Under-the-hood Improvements
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- Local repo URIs are now allowed on DEBUG mode
- Added ':pserver:' as a prefix for CVS repos
- Do not delete POFiles when cleaning cache. This fixes a problem when cleaning
  and refreshing the component cache. This patch allows Tx to continue
  cleaning/refreshing the component cache but without deleting the POFiles. They
  are set as enabled=False and hidden from the UI. A project or component
  deletion still removes the POFiles that belong to it.
- Added Tx repository revision into the footer. Helpful to identify the exact
  revision used to run a Tx instance running from a devel branch.
- Added project look-up for django-ajax-select queries.
- Further restrict the regex for URLs that contain filenames.
- Split Catalan into two languages: 'ca' and 'ca@valencia' (#613).
- Added template escaping on all firstof tags.
- Added support for intltool multi-domain projects.
- Disable Lotte for broken pofiles.
- Show i18n method on component page (#349).


Improved Mercurial Back-end
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Mercurial back-end now updates whenever a pull is done, avoiding the creation
  of local new heads in the repo history
- After some scrutiny tests we realized that using 'tip'
  as the default branch might be troublesome for repos that have
  named branches, so it was reverted back to 'default'.
- The 'commands.push' command doesn't use a 'revs' argument, so
  we turned it into 'branch' argument.


Bugfixes
::::::::

- Fixed issues with Dutch language (#537)
- Fix for the "DoesNotExist: ObservedItem matching query does not exist."
  exception. Whenever a component has its cache cleaned, all the related POFile
  objects are now deleted. This way, other objects that use those POFiles are
  also deleted in cascade. The repowatch app does not use the POFile object and
  'cascade' is not applied.
- Fixed permission check for components with multiple PO files
- Calling correct method on the component get_stats method
- Fixed Lotte data session wizard craziness when changing pages (#552)
- Fixed URL for components with multiple po files per language
- Handling user object on the svn lib with more properties (#565)
- Fixed registration problem, occurring after merging.
- Added a dependency into a projects app migration script
- Fixed permission check for team coordinators
- Converted exception output into a string before using it
- Missing JS lib for the component multiple POFiles page
- Fix wrapping of multi-line messages on top of page.
- Made form errors more visible
- Fixed get_or_none method for the Team class (#531)
- Fixed some permission checks on the component_submit_file view
- Fixed multiple copies of same event on timeline lists (#528)
- Fix an issue in run commands where no env was passed via kwargs.
- Bugfix: the rev kwarg should not be passed to hg pull cause we do not pull
  specific revision numbers!
- Improved get_log templatetag for the actionlog app
- Fix SITE_URL_PREFIX generation with request.build_absolute_uri("") call
- Added option to enable django-contact app URL
- Added option to setup up the Django admin panel URL
- BUGFix: Variable initialization was missing in settings file.
- Fix initializers of test_svn.
- Minor cleanup on the bzr repositories.
- Added empty models.py file on modules that didn't have one.
- When skip_stats was in effect the pofiles was equal to None.
- Improved debugging for the stats calculation process
- Fixed stats calc whenever a POT changes (#583, #587)
- Added django-staticfiles context processors
- Do not delete POFiles when cleaning cache
- Clear unlocking of files
- Added a permission check for lock info
- Added Tx repository revision into the footer
- txstatsrefresh command has been setup to correctly register addon handlers.
- A simple templatetag to wrap the size_human utility method.
- Fixed file locking through Lotte (#593): When a user now tries to open up
  Lotte for a file locked by someone else, a message is shown explaining that
  only submission through a review are allowed.

Transifex, at http://www.transifex.com/. 

Project and community managers who want to deploy Transifex for their 
own community can get Transifex in a variety of ways. A tarball is available
from the following locations:

* The Python Packaging Index (Cheeseshop): http://pypi.python.org/pypi/transifex/

RPM packages for the latest versions of Fedora may soon be available
via yum. The same applies for RHEL 5, CentOS 5, and Scientific Linux 5, from
the `Fedora EPEL`_ yum repository::

    yum install transifex transifex-extras 

Information about installing Transifex can be found in the
:ref:`Installation documentation <installing>`.


The Transifex Appliance
:::::::::::::::::::::::

If you want to play with the latest Transifex code, you may want to use our
development images for the Transifex Appliance. Following the stand-alone,
"batteries included" model of software appliances, you get a complete
Transifex system with all dependencies and services pre-configured so that
you can start experimenting with it right away. Choose from ISO, VMware or EC2
images, for both x86 and x86_64 architectures to run on a virtual machine,
dedicated server, or using virtualization software.

.. image:: /static/images/shots/0.7/0.7_appliance_front_page.png
   :class: shot2 alcenter

Your appliances can be updated using its own web based management system by
pointing your browser to the appliance's IP using port 8003. Login with the
credentials 'admin' and 'password'. Make sure to change the password once
you've successfully logged in.

This appliance version is based on the latest branch of Transifex, where a
couple of projects have already been created for you to play with. Log in using
either guest/guest or editor/editor as your user name and password combination
and tinker to your heart's content!

Make sure to read the documentation and file issues/send us your feedback.

Upgrading to this version
-------------------------

To upgrade the code, update your package distribution as usual:

- If you installed from your package distribution, check if there's been a
  package upgrade and go for it.
- If you used ``easy_install``, run ``easy_install -U`` to upgrade.
- Fresh tarballs are available, if you installed from a release zipfile.
- Finally, if you're of the daredevil kind and feed straight from the source,
  ``hg pull`` followed by an ``hg update <version>`` should do the trick for you.


Dependencies
::::::::::::

The following dependencies were *added* in this version:

- Django = 1.1.2
- South >= 0.7
- django-threadedcomments >= 0.9
- django-addons
- django-staticfiles
- pygooglechart

.. warning::

  This version is not compatible with Django 1.2 or later, due to numerous
  changes in this version. To install a specific version of Django using
  ``easy_install`` you may run ``easy_install Django==1.1.2``.

Instructions on how to install them can be found at the
:ref:`Installation docs <installing>`. You'll need to complete this step
before actually doing the database upgrade.


Database migration
::::::::::::::::::

Transifex includes a script which will automatically migrate your database to
the new schema from the previous version. All you need to do, from a clean
schema of the previous version, is run the following::

    ./manage.py syncdb
    ./manage.py migrate
    ./manage.py build_static
    cd transifex/site_media/
    mv userprofile media/userprofile
    mv reviews_files media/reviews_files

Transifex 0.9.1
===============

Released:
  24 September 2010
  
This release includes an important command called 'txcreatemap', which is
necessary to upgrade to 1.0::

    $ ./manage.py txcreatemap --help
    Usage: ./manage.py txcreatemap [options] <project_slug project_slug ...>
    
        Create a JSON formatted mapping of the POT files and theirs translations
        (PO) for projects, converting components into resources. Each project
        component has it own mapping which is stored in the database within the
        ``jsonmap.models.JSONMap`` model.
    
        This mapping can be used by the CLI app of Transifex as the ``.tx/txdata``
        file content in the remote repository.
    
        Project slugs can be passed by argument to map specific projects. If no
        argument is passed the mapping will happen for all the projects in the
        database.
    
        This mapping is used to migrate versions <= 0.9.x to the 1.0 version of
        Transifex.
