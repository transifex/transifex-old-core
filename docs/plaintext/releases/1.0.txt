 Transifex version 1.0.x release notes
=======================================
 
 
Transifex 1.0 (Proteus) Alpha (development version)
===================================================
 
Welcome to Transifex 1.0, codenamed Proteus_.
 
To be Released:
  October 2010

 
Transifex 1.0 'Proteus' is a major production release of Transifex. It is
targeted for new installations of Transifex and parties willing to upgrade to
a new major version to take advantage of new features.

Transifex 1.0 represents arguably the single biggest advancement in Transifex
since its original release. This release got something like a 'heart transplant':
a brand-new core storage engine was introduced, capable of much more than the
file-based previous one.

You can experience Transifex 1.0 live at the upstream instance hosted by
Indifex, at http://www.transifex.net/. 

Project and community managers who want to deploy Transifex for their 
own community can get Transifex in a variety of ways. Transifex should be
easily-installable::

    easy_install transifex

A tarball is available from the following locations:

- The Transifex.org Download section: http://transifex.org/files/
- The Python Packaging Index (Cheeseshop): http://pypi.python.org/pypi/transifex/

Full information about installing Transifex can be found in the
:ref:`Installation documentation <intro-install>`.


The Transifex Appliance
:::::::::::::::::::::::

If you want to play with the latest Transifex code, you may want to use our
development images for the Transifex Appliance. Following the stand-alone,
"batteries included" model of software appliances, you get a complete
Transifex system with all dependencies and services pre-configured so that
you can start experimenting with it right away. Choose from ISO, VMware or EC2
images, for both x86 and x86_64 architectures to run on a virtual machine,
dedicated server, or using virtualization software.

Your appliances can be updated using its own web based management system by
pointing your browser to the appliance's IP using port 8003. Login with the
credentials 'admin' and 'password'. Make sure to change the password once
you've successfully logged in.

This appliance version is based on the latest branch of Transifex, where a
couple of projects have already been created for you to play with. Log in using
either guest/guest or editor/editor as your user name and password combination
and tinker to your heart's content!

Make sure to read the documentation and file issues/send us your feedback.

Upgrading to this version
-------------------------

To upgrade the code, update your package distribution as usual:

- If you installed from your package distribution, check if there's been a
  package upgrade and go for it.
- If you used ``easy_install``, run ``easy_install -U`` to upgrade.
- Fresh tarballs are available, if you installed from a release zipfile.
- Finally, if you're of the daredevil kind and feed straight from the source,
  ``hg pull`` followed by an ``hg update <version>`` should do the trick for you.


Dependencies
::::::::::::

One extra dependency was *added* since the last major version:

- python-magic

One dependency is *no longer* required starting from this version:

- mercurial

Instructions on how to install the dependencies can be found at the
:ref:`Installation docs <intro-install>`. You'll need to complete this step
before actually doing the database migration.


Migration
:::::::::

.. warning::

  Due to the totally different storage engine, Transifex 1.0 requires a number
  of steps to fully migrate your projects.

  (Section incomplete)


Transifex includes a script which will automatically migrate your database to
the new schema from the previous version. To upgrade the database from a clean
schema of the previous version, is run the following::

    ./manage.py syncdb
    ./manage.py migrate

Finally, re-build and setup the necessary extra files::

    ./manage.py build_static
    cd transifex/site_media/
