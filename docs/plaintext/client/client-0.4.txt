.. _user-client-04:

=======================
 Transifex Client v0.4
=======================

.. note::

  This document describes Transifex Client **v0.4.x** (outdated).  
  There are also docs for the
  :ref:`development version <user-client-devel>` and for
  :ref:`older releases <user-client-releases>`.


The Transifex Command-line Client is a command line tool that enables you to
easily manage your translations within a project without the need of an
elaborate UI system.

You can use the command line client to easily create new
resources, map locale files to translations and synchronize your Transifex
project with your local repository and vice verca. Translators and localization
managers can also use it to handle large volumes of translation files easily
and without much hassle.


.. _user-client-install:

Getting the client
==================


Latest stable version
---------------------

The Transifex Client can be found on various places, including your system's
software repositories. For example, in Fedora, you should be able to install it
by running::

    (sudo) sudo yum install transifex-client

The client is also available at the Python Package Index (PYPI).
The following command will install the latest version of the client or update
your existing version::

    (sudo) easy_install --upgrade transifex-client



Development version
-------------------

The :ref:`development version <user-client-devel>` of the client can be found
in the development source code repository. You can fetch the repository
using Mercurial::

  $ git clone git@github.com:transifex/transifex-client.git

or by directly downloading the 'tip' version in zip or tarball form from
the `repository web front-end <http://code.transifex.com/transifex-client/downloads>`_.

To install it, simply use ``setuptools`` as follows::

  $ cd transifex-client
  (sudo) python setup.py install


Installing without root access
------------------------------

It's also possible to install the client on systems on which you don't have
superuser access usinv virtualenv.

1. Install virtualenv:

   Now, here we have a little chicken & egg problem, because to install
   virtualenv, you either need root access, or you need to install it below
   your home directory and make Python find it. The good thing is, you don't
   need to install virtualenv to use it, you can just run the the script
   directly from the directory where you unpacked the distriution.

   If you want to install virtualenv and can live with gaining root
   privileges just once for this occasion, then do the following::

     $ sudo easy_install virtualenv
     # OR something like: sudo yum install python-virtualenv

   If you can't or don't want to install it as root, follow these steps:

   1. Download ``virtualenv-X.Y.tar.gz`` from the virtualenv_ PyPI page.
   2. Unpack the tarball.
   3. In step two below, substitute ``virtualenv`` with the full path to the
      virtualenv.py script located in the directory you just unpacked.

2. Create & activate a new environment::

     $ virtualenv </path/to/new/environment>
     $ source </path/to/new/environment>/bin/activate

3. Install the client using setuptools::

     easy_install --upgrade transifex-client

.. _virtualenv: http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/virtualenv


.. note: Instructions above originally found at the TurboGears wiki.


Using the client
================

To make sure that transifex-client was installed correctly, try running it
with the following command::

    tx --help

If everything was completed, then you should see a brief help message
and basic instructions on how to use the tool. You can also view
the available commands by running::

    tx help

To get more information for each command you can use ``tx help *command*``.


Command list
------------

A brief introduction to the most commonly used commands provided by
transifex-client follows.

.. _user-client-init:

init
~~~~

The ``tx init`` command is used to initialize a project.

This is very similar to the way most :term:`VCS` systems treat the init
command. Use this command to create a new project in the current directory.
This way you will be able to manage all translation files of the project that
exist under the project's root directory.

Here's a sample run:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ tx init
  Creating .tx folder...
  Transifex instance [http://www.transifex.com]: 
  Creating skeleton...
  Creating config file...
  No configuration file found.
  No entry found for host http://www.transifex.com. Creating...
  Please enter your transifex username: user
  Password: <...>
  Updating /home/fim/.transifexrc file...
  Done.

Where to run init from
::::::::::::::::::::::

You may run this command from anywhere on your filesystem. It will basically
create a small file which stores the mapping between your local files and
Transifex resources.

If you have a software project in VCS and would like to commit this config
file, in order to make it available to anyone who clones your repository, run
the command in the root directory of your repo.

You might be managing multiple projects and would like a single configuration
file. This is common with translators, who use the client to manage their
contributions across projects. In this case, you may run this command outside
of the git repos.

.. note::
  
  If you want to automate the project initialization, the init command
  offers some options to set the default host, username and password so that
  you can use it with `non-interactive` scripts. For more info check the help
  page of the command (``'tx help init'``).


set
~~~

``tx set [options]``

This command is an aggregation of all functions needed to initialize and setup
a local Tx project either with by using local files or remote files directly
from the Transifex server. 


auto-remote
:::::::::::

``tx set --auto-remote <url>``

The command above can be used to initialize a local project for the remote
**Project**, **Release** or **Resource** specified by the url. Then you can
pull or push translation files from and to the server as usual. The supported
urls are the following:

+----------+-------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Type     | URL                                                         | Description                                     |
+==========+=============================================================+=================================================+
| Resource | http://www.transifex.com/projects/p/transifex/resource/txo/ | Set up a single resource.                       | 
+----------+-------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Project  | http://www.transifex.com/projects/p/transifex/              | Set up all resources under this project.        |
+----------+-------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Release  | http://www.transifex.com/projects/p/transifex/r/tx-1_0/     | Set up all resources belonging to this release. |
+----------+-------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+


auto-local
::::::::::

``tx set --auto-local -r <project.resource> <expr> --source-lang en [--source-file <file>]``

This command can be used to automatically initialize a Tx project by using
local files. The project must already exist on the Transifex server, so if you
haven't already created it, login to the web interface and do so.

* **project.resource**: Your project and resource 'slugs', separated by a dot.
  These are the strings found on your project's URL and together they uniquely
  identify your translatable resource. For example, if you have a URL such
  as www.transifex.com/projects/p/myproject/r/myresource/, the unique slug
  will be "myproject.myresource".

* **source_lang**: This is the source language of your resource, such as 'en'
  for English.

* **expr**: An expression which reflects the file/directory structure of your
  translation files. The expression **must** contain the ``'<lang>'`` keyword
  denoting where the file paths differentiate per language, for example:
  ``translations/po/<lang>.po``.
  
* If your source file doesn't follow that schema, you can specify a custom
  path for the source file using the ``'--source-file file'`` option.

For example, let's say you have a class open-source git-hosted Gettext-i18nized
project. Here's a set of commands you might use to create a resource off your
master branch::

  $ git clone http://git.example.com/git/myproject.git
  $ cd myproject
  $ tx init
  $ tx set --auto-local -r myproject.master 'po/<lang>.po' --source-lang en \
    --source-file po/myproject.pot
  $ tx push -s -t
  Pushing 'el' translations (file: po/el.po)
  Pushing 'gu' translations (file: po/gu.po)
  Pushing 'mr' translations (file: po/mr.po)

There is no requirement for your pot file name to match your resource name,
but the consistency might benefit others who come along later.


Other commands
::::::::::::::

``tx set --source -r <project.resource> -l <lang> <file>``

This command simply sets the source file and the source language of a specific
resource. It can be used to initialize new resources or update existing ones.
  
``tx set -r <project.resource> -l <lang> <file>``

This command can be used to set individual translation files mapped to a
certain language. This is useful when your translation files don't use a
common naming schema and the ``--auto-local`` command cannot be used.


status
~~~~~~

``tx status``

This is a simple command that displays the existing project configuration
in a more human readable format. It lists all resources that have been
initialized under the local project and all their associated translation
files.

Sample output::

    $ tx status
    myproject -> default (1 of 1)
    Translation Files:
     - en: po/smolt.pot (source)
     - ar: po/ar.po
     - as: po/as.po 
     - bg: po/bg.po 
     - bn_IN: po/bn_IN.p
     ...

push
~~~~

``tx push``

This command sends local changes to the Transifex server. If you have
added new source files, the corresponding resources are created on
the Transifex server and if you have new translations those will get
pushed as well. This can also be used to update existing source files or
translations on the server with new strings.

When pushing source files, Transifex will update the source strings of a
resource to match those from the new source file. This operation may result in
loss of information, so please pay extra attention when pushing a source file.

Here's how differences between the old and new source files will be handled:

- New strings will be added.
- Modified strings will be considered new ones and added as well.
- Strings which do not exist in the new source file (including ones which have
  been modified) will be removed from the database, along with their
  translations.

To make common operations more efficient and avoid deleting the work of
translators, the Transifex client tries to guess whether it should push a
file or skip it. This decision is based on the timestamp of the file on the
server and the timestamp of the file in your directory.

If the timestamp on the server is newer, this probably means that a translator
has worked on the file, and it will not push your outdated file. Use
``--force`` to enforce file pushing.


pull
~~~~

``tx pull``

This command updates your local files by pulling the latest translations
from the server as well as new translation files that were created in
the Transifex UI. By default, this command will check if the modification time
of your local files is more recent than that on the Transifex server and will
not overwrite newer files. If you want to force the download of specific
files, use the ``--force`` option.

Managing your project
=====================

For information regarding projects and what they represent, check :ref:`the
appropriate documentation <user-projects>`.


Creating a project
------------------

Currently, the client doesn't support creating a project directly from the
command line. So, in order to create a project, you need to visit the project
creation page and fill out the corresponding form. Once you have created your
project, the only thing you need is the project slug, which is part of the
project details page URL (usually it is in the following format:
``http://transifex.com/projects/p/<project_url>/``).

Once you have a project created on the Transifex site, go into your project's
root directory and run the *tx init* command. This will initialize your local
project and will create all necessary configuration files. Once this is
finished you are ready to go on to the next step....


Managing your translations
--------------------------

Automatic setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Transifex-client offers a smart and easy way to automatically setup and track
your translation files provided that all of them have a common naming schema.
If for example, you have all translation files under a directory structure
similar to this::

  po/en.po
  po/de.po
  po/el.po
  po/fi.po
  po/ar.po

then, you could use an expression to group them together like
``'po/<lang>.po``.

The transifex-client can keep track of multiple files by using expressions
like the one above with the special keyword ``<lang>`` denoting where the
language code is specified in the file path. So, in order to quickly setup
your project, you just issue the following command::

  tx set -r <project_slug>.<resource_slug> -s en 'po/<lang>.po'

Even if you're using separate source files for translations (for example POT
based projects) you can specify the source file on the command above using the
``-f <file>`` option like this::

  tx set -r <project_slug>.<resource_slug> -s en -f <file> 'po/<lang>.po'

After that, you should have your project's translation files under tx
management. The benefits of this approach instead of handling one by one the
translation files is that you can add/remove files dynamically without having
to edit the configuration files of transifex-client. Also, the file pattern
provides an easy way for transifex-client to guess where new translations
should be saved when downloaded from the server.

.. note:: 
  
  Even if you're using the automatic way of setting up your project, you
  can setup specific translation files that don't match the global
  expression as exceptions by using the manual way to setup translation
  files which is described in the next part.

Manual setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In most cases, the automatic setup procedures should cover most scenarios but
there are always people who prefer to do it the hard way. The
``transifex-client`` offers a way to use static mapping between locales and
files which may be what you need if your translation files don't share a
common naming scheme. 

So, in order to setup your project, first you need to create a resource with
an assigned source file. To do this, you should run the following command:: 

    tx set --source -r <project_slug>.<resource_slug> -l <language> source_file

.. note:: 
  
  The resource name cannot contain special characters. The only valid
  characters are alphanumeric, the hyphen and the underscore.

Once you have created a mapping between a source file and a resource, you
should add more translations to this resource. To do this simply run the
following for every language::

    tx set -r <project_slug>.<resource_slug> -l <language> translation_file

After doing this for all available languages, you can check the existing
mapping using the ``tx status`` command. 

Pull/Push
~~~~~~~~~

When you're sure that the mapping is correct, you can push your files to the
Transifex server using the ``tx push`` command. If it's the first time pushing
a project to Transifex, you should always use the ``-s|--source`` flag with the
``push`` command in order to push the source file. If you want to push the
translation files as well you should use the ``-t|--translations`` in addition
to the ``-s`` flag. By using the ``-s`` flag, the Transifex server will create
a corresponding resource to each pushed source file if it doesn't exist on the
server. On consecutive pushes, you may omit this flag and only include it
whenever you want to update the source strings in your resource. 

Whenever you've done some work in the online translation editor on Transifex
and you want to incorporate those changes back into your project, you can
simply run ``tx pull``. If you also want to pull new translation files, you
can add the ``'-a|--all'`` flag to the ``pull`` command but you should know
that if you haven't setup your project by using a file expression, you need to
move and track the new translation files manually after downloading them.  


.. note:: Depending on the size of the files and the number of languages, this
    process can take up to several minutes as it requires uploading all files,
    parsing them, extracting the available strings, and storing them into the
    database.  To avoid misuse of the API, we have some throttling mechanisms
    in play which should not interfere with your work but just to be safe,
    whenever uploading or downloading from the Transifex server, if you want a
    specific resource or language use the ``-r/--resource`` and
    ``-l/--language`` options of the ``push``/``pull`` commands to avoid
    pushing/pulling all of the tracked files.


Configuration files
-------------------

All of the configuration files that the ``transifex-client`` is using are
simple text files that you can edit by hand. In this section, we will go over
the structure of each configuration file so that if you need to edit a file by
hand, you'll know what to look for.

The ``transifex-client`` is using two basic configuration files. The first one
is ``.transifexrc`` and is unique per user. In this file, we store the
username and password for every Transifex server that you are using as well as
the hostnames.

.. code-block:: ini

    [http://www.transifex.com]
    username = user
    token = 
    password = p@ssw0rd
    hostname = http://www.transifex.com

    [http://www.transifex.com]
    username = user2
    token = 
    password = p@ssw0rd2
    hostname = http://www.transifex.com

If you change your password on a Transifex server for example, you should
edit this file with the new password. The ``token`` variable should be left
blank.

Apart from the system-wide ``.transifexrc``, ``transifex-client`` uses a
per project configuration file to store the project's details and the
file-to-resource mappings. This file is stored in ``.tx/config`` of your
project's root directory and has the following outline:

.. code-block:: ini

  [main]
  host = http://www.transifex-server.com

  [project_slug.resource_slug]
  file_filter = po/<lang>.po
  source_file = po/myproj.pot
  source_lang = en
  trans.fi = translations/fi/LC_MESSAGES/django.po

A quick rundown of the sections and options appearing in the config file
follows

* **[main] section**
  
  In this section we have project-wide options such as the default transifex
  host for all projects. These can be overriden by each project in case it
  is needed.

* **[project_slug.resource_slug]** 

  * *source_lang*: this is the source language of the resource.
  * *source_file*: this points to the source file directly.
  * *file_filter*: here we hold the expression used to identify translation files under the specific project. [not mandatory]
  * *trans.<lang>*: this is used for translation files that don't follow a common naming schema and the file expression cannot be used to track them. [not mandatory]
  * *host*: in case the project doesn't use the default Transifex server as specified in the **[main] section**, it can override it using this option. [not mandatory]

So if you ever need to change the language of a file or correct the file path
for a specific translation, you can edit this file directly.

.. warning:: Transifex does not offer a way to revert your ``config``
    configuration back after some unsuccessful changes so make sure you
    backup the original file before editing by hand.

.. _user-client-sample-usage:


Sample Usage
============


For Developers
--------------

Let's assume you are the maintainer of the Transifex project itself, and you
want to setup your project to use Transifex for translations. First of all,
change into your project's main directory, such as your VCS directory root.
Then, issue the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  [user@host:~/transifex]$ tx init
  Creating .tx folder...
  Transifex instance [http://www.transifex.com]: 
  Creating skeleton...
  Creating config file...
  No configuration file found.
  No entry found for host http://www.transifex.com. Creating...
  Please enter your transifex username: user
  Password: 
  Updating /home/user/.transifexrc file...
  Done.

To ask Transifex to detect your files automatically, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  [user@host:~/transifex]$ tx set --auto-local -r transifex.txo  -s en 'po/<lang>.po'
  Only printing the commands which will be run if the --execute switch is specified.

  tx set --source -r transifex.txo -l en po/en.po

  tx set -r transifex.txo -l bal po/bal.po
  tx set -r transifex.txo -l bn_IN po/bn_IN.po
  tx set -r transifex.txo -l ca po/ca.po
  tx set -r transifex.txo -l cs po/cs.po
  tx set -r transifex.txo -l da po/da.po
  ...
  Done.



If everything looks good, issue the command again with the ``--execute`` switch:
 
.. code-block:: bash

  [user@host:~/transifex]$ tx set --auto-local -r transifex.txo  -s en 'po/<lang>.po' --execute
  Updating source for resource transifex.txo ( en -> po/en.po ).
  Setting source file for resource transifex.txo ( en ->   po/en.po ).
  Updating file expression for resource transifex.txo ( po/<lang>.po ).
  Done.


Finally, here's a sample run with manual mapping of your files:

.. code-block:: bash

  [user@host:~/transifex]$ tx --traceback set --source -r transifex.txo -l en po/en.po
  Setting source file for resource transifex.txo ( en -> po/en.po ).
  Done.

  [user@host:~/transifex]$ tx --traceback set -r transifex.txo -l el po/el.po
  Updating translations for resource transifex.txo ( el -> po/el.po ).
  Done.


After that, once your mapping is done you can push or pull freely to the
Transifex server. If it's the first time you're setting up your project, you
should probably push your files to the Transifex server with the following
command:


.. code-block:: bash

  [user@host:~/transifex]$ tx push --source --translations
  Pushing translations for resource transifex.txo:
  Pushing source file (po/en.po)
  Pushing 'el' translation (file: po/el.po).
  Pushing 'hu' translation (file: po/hu.po).
  Pushing 'zh_TW' translation (file:  po/zh_TW.po).
  ...
  Pushing 'te' translations (file: po/te.po)
  Pushing 'pl' translations (file: po/pl.po)
  Done.

Then, you can visit the Transifex server and view the available translations
from the web UI. Let's say, you translate your project into more languages and
just before the new release, you want to update the translations. In that
case, this is what you should do:

.. code-block:: bash

  [user@host:~/transifex]$ tx pull -a
  Pulling translations for resource transifex.txo (source:
  po/en.po)
  New translations found for the following languages: nb, tg, xh
  Pulling 'el' translation (file: po/el.po).
  Pulling 'hu' translation (file: po/hu.po).
  Pulling 'zh_TW' translation (file:  po/zh_TW.po).
  Pulling 'bn_IN' translation (file:  po/bn_IN.po).
  ...
  Pulling 'te' translation (file: po/te.po).
  Pulling 'pl' translation (file: po/pl.po).
  Pulling new translations for source file po/en.po
   -> nb: ./po/nb.po
  Done.

Notice the 'nb' language: the new translation file is now managed by Transifex,
which means that in subsequent pushes/pulls this will be updated as well.

For Translators
---------------

If you're a translator, you don't really care for all the files included in a
project but just the actual translation files. To make the workflow for
translators easier, transifex-client offers the ability to initialize a local
project by getting the translation files of a project directly from the
Transifex server instead of the project's VCS. 

So, in order to begin, you must first create a folder and ``cd`` into it. Then you
run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    [user@host:~/trans-project]$ tx init
    Creating .tx folder...
    Transifex instance [http://www.transifex.com]:
    Creating skeleton...
    Creating config file...
    No configuration file found.
    No entry found for host http://www.transifex.com. Creating...
    Please enter your transifex username: user
    Password:
    Updating /home/user/.transifexrc file...
    Done.

    [user@host:~/trans-project]$ tx set --auto-remote  http://www.transifex.com/projects/p/transifex/
    Auto configuring local project from remote URL...
    Getting details for project transifex
    2 resources found. Configuring...
    Configuring resource txo.
    Configuring resource meegotouch.
    Done.

Now, you should be ready to pull the translation files for the resources of
this project. To do it, simply run the ``pull`` command with the ``-a|--all``
flag set:

.. code-block:: bash

  [user@host:~/testpo]$ tx pull -a
  Pulling translations for resource transifex.txo (source: None)
  New translations found for the following languages: bal, bn_IN, ca, zh_CN,
  zh_TW, cs, da, nl, en_GB, et, fr, gl, de, he, hu, id, it, ja, lv, ms, nb, pa,
  fa, pl, pt, pt_BR, ro, ru, sr, sk, es, sv, tg, te, uk, xh
  Skipping 'el' translation (file: translations/transifex.txo/el.po).
  Skipping 'sq' translation (file: translations/transifex.txo/sq.po).
  Pulling new translations for source file None
   -> bal: ./translations/transifex.txo/bal.po
   -> bn_IN: ./translations/transifex.txo/bn_IN.po
   ...
   -> te: ./translations/transifex.txo/te.po
   -> uk: ./translations/transifex.txo/uk.po
   -> xh: ./translations/transifex.txo/xh.po
  Done.

Now you can translate any of these files using your preferred editor and push
it back to the server.

.. note::

  The url we used above is a project url which tells transifex-client
  to configure all available resources under this specific project. Instead of a
  project url, you can pass a resource or a release url to the ``tx`` command
  and it will auto-setup a specific resource or all resources under the
  specified release. The workflow is similar in all cases.
