Transifex is a modern, open-source localization platform. It's a web system
which automates the translation workflow of complex international projects.

Transifex helps projects work with an open community of translators to make
their product available to a global audience. It helps software developers,
documentation writers and webmasters globalize their products (or localize,
depending on how one chooses to see the process) by openly receiving
translations from a wide community via a dead-simple, batteries-included set
of tools, which integrate well with existing workflows.


Goals
=====

Some of the core goals of Transifex are the following:

* Provide an interface for translators to submit translations to multiple 
  projects, regardless of the type of the underlying VCS.
* Reduce the overhead a project maintainer usually undertakes to 
  administrate accounts for translators.
* Help translators do more by eliminating the need to subscribe to each 
  VCS and learn its commands and tricks.
* Encourage collaboration between developers and maintainers and 
  thus, increase the language coverage of the participant projects.


Transifex.net
=============

Projects with a significant size, such as the Fedora or Moblin distributions,
can benefit with a self-hosted Transifex instance. Most other projects though
will probably want to use one which already has an established community and
the necessary tools to help the project get translated.

Transifex.net_ is a one-stop, batteries-included service which serves
translations to independent projects, which don't have to worry about deploying
their own instance, growing a community and managing the infrastructure.
Transifex.net is managed by Indifex_, the company sponsoring the development
of Transifex itself.
