==========================

Released:
  To be released in early May

Welcome to the Transifex 0.6 release, codenamed Apocalypse_.

This release marks a major release in the advancement of Transifex, and includes
a number of new exciting new features and many, many bugfixes. It is currently
scheduled to be released in late April 2009 and is targeted for new
installations of Transifex and parties who choose to migrate to a new major
version and enjoy the new features.

Transifex 0.6 is intended for production use.


What's new in Transifex 0.6
---------------------------

The following major features were introduced in this release.


Tarball repositories
::::::::::::::::::::

In addition to pulling from sources hosted on revision-controlled repositories,
Transifex now adds beta support for tarball sources (``.tar.gz`` files).
With this feature, the need that projects should be hosted on a VCS is raised,
and shipped releases of projects can now be translated as well.

Tarball sources also features experimental support for submission of
translation files. These submissions are not being pushed upstream to the
tarball but reside on the Transifex server itself. In the future, translations
could be sent to an email address too.

.. warning::

  Clearing the local cache of tarball brings in a newly pulled tarball,
  overwriting the local files. Projects enabling submissions to tarballs
  should note that any submissions sent would be overwritten with a fresh
  extract of the tarball from the remote server.
 


User Notifications
::::::::::::::::::

.. image:: ../_screenshots/0.6-notices.png
   :class: shot

Watching translation files
  Transifex can now monitor the repositories it follows for changes and
  identify when files have been modified. Users can 'watch' their favorite file
  by clicking its 'Watch' icon, and get notified by Transifex when the file
  has been changed, either by an upstream commit or by a submission through
  Transifex itself.

Watching projects
  Users can also subscribe to projects and get notified, for example, whenever
  new components are added or deleted. This can be useful when a user wants to
  get notified when a project branches off for a new release.

Notifying maintainers for I18n errors
  Project maintainers are now being notified when their project has issues with
  its i18n support causing translation statistics generation fails. An example
  is intltool-powered projects having issues generating their source files
  (POT).

Notifications can be delivered in a number of ways. The user's latest
notifications are collected on the user's profile page. In addition, users
have the choice to also receive the notifications by email. In the future,
more channels could be supported.


Multiple files per language
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::

.. image:: ../_screenshots/0.6-multifile.png
   :class: shot

Transifex now adds support for components shipping multiple translation files
per language. The groups of files per language-component are now identified and
associated with their language, and their completion percentages are
grouped in one statistics bar for the language. The breakdown of the files is
shown on a separate page, along with the usual actions on each file (download,
view, lock, etc).

For each of these translation files, the source file is also identified and its
contents are msgmerged with the files, producing up-to-date statistics. 


Internationalization support
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

.. image:: ../_screenshots/0.6-langs.png
   :class: shot
   
Transifex's user interface is now internationalized, and includes support for
viewing it in the user's preferred language. A drop-down menu shows the
available languages on the top-right part of the screen, allowing overriding
of the detected preference.

A new management command has been added, ``txmakemessage``, which creates the
PO files on-the-fly from the source code and templates.

Following the policy 'eat our own dogfood', Transifex is in fact translatable
through Transifex itself. Volunteer contributions for new translations and
improvements in the existing translations are submitted through Transifex at
http://www.transifex.net/.


Translation file archives
:::::::::::::::::::::::::

.. image:: ../_screenshots/0.6-zip.png
   :class: shot
   
Transifex now adds support for downloading compressed archives containing the
files belonging to a release for a particular language. The compressed archive
types supported are **zip files** and gzipped **tarballs**.

Translators can now retrieve a compressed file containing all the files needed
to translate the release's components to their language. An example URL
providing this feature is ``/languages/fr/collection/gnome/2.26/download_zip/``.

This feature eliminates the need to download one file at a time, and is
especially useful for very active contributors and people with slow Internet
connectivity.


User Interface improvements
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::

During the development cycle of 0.6, quite a few improvements in the user
interface took place here and there. Here's a list of the most important ones:

Untranslated components list
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The language-release page now include a list of components which haven't
had any translations so far. This gives a better picture of the parts which
need translation to make the completion status increase.

More RSS feeds
""""""""""""""
The release page with the completion percentage of each language is now
published also as an RSS feed, allowing people like release engineer to easily
check the translation status of their release.

Easy file selection for editing
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
.. image:: ../_screenshots/0.6-target.png
   :class: shot

The 'advanced' submission form now supports either editing a remote file or
creating a new one. The user can choose either to overwrite an existing
file or create a new one.

Sortable statistics tables
""""""""""""""""""""""""""
.. image:: ../_screenshots/0.6-longbars.png
   :class: shot

The tables presented are now sortable by a number of variables, including
the language name and the completion percentage.

Better whitespace usage
"""""""""""""""""""""""

Statistics bars now support arbitrary lengths (and by default longer), making
better use of the whitespace, increasing readability and allowing the designer
to more easily choose how to present the information.


Under the hood changes
::::::::::::::::::::::

This release introduces some improvements in the platform itself, which might
interest people who administrate their own Transifex instance or build on top
of the platform.

Revamped settings mechanism
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Settings are now organized in multiple files under the ``settings/``
directory, allowing easier management and override. (r456)

Improved abstraction for repositories
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Backend support for repositories has been improved to allow more types of
repos to pull from. The new ``codebases`` application has been
introduced which abstracts the VCS functionality for the ``vcs`` and
``tarball`` applications.

Improved languages support
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- More languages have been added for commonly used locale codes (#200).
- Language creation command added: ``(python manage.py) create_languages``.
- After first syncdb, admin is prompted for language creation (#213).

Action logging
""""""""""""""

The action log support has been re-engineered to allow more notifications of
changes and better reporting. It includes more clear HTML templates and text
and can refer to different objects resulting in increase of performance and
usability.

Bugfixes from 0.5.x
-------------------

In addition to the bugfixes introduced in the maintenance
:ref:`0.5.x releases <releases-0.5>`, the following issues have also been fixed:

- Default mode of operation is now DEBUG.
- Fixed ordering in language-release feed (fixes #149) (Markos Fragkakis)
- Run msgfmt check and stats calculation only for .po files
- Changing a repository root url now deletes the local cache of the repository.
- List of releases for components is now filtered by the collections chosen in
  the project. Additionally, when a collection is dropped from a project, the
  components of the project also reflect that change, removing releases related
  to that collection.
- Regular expressions in ComponentForm are now validated for correctness.


Upgrading to 0.6
----------------

- The schema for the tables that store the remote repository information
  has changed. If there is no information in the tables then a
  ``python manage.py reset codebases tarball vcs`` will update your database.
- The settings files have been broken down for easier maintenance in
  ``settings/``. The ``settings.py`` file needs to be overwritten with the new
  version and settings migrated to the respective ``.conf`` files. 

(This section urgently needs more text.)
