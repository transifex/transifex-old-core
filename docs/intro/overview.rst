Overview
========

Transifex is a highly scalable localization platform with a focus on 
integrating well with the existing workflow of both translators and developers.

It aims in making it dead-simple for content providers to receive quality 
translations from big translation communities, no matter where the 
project is hosted. 

* Homepage: http://transifex.org/

Goals
-----

* Provide an interface for translators to submit translations to multiple 
  projects, regardless of the type of the underlying VCS.
* Reduce the overhead a project maintainer usually undertakes to 
  administrate accounts for translators.
* Help translators do more by eliminating the need to subscribe to each 
  VCS and learn its commands and tricks.
* Encourage collaboration between developers and maintainers and 
  thus, increasethe language coverage of the participant projects.
